**The Logic of Anti-Corruption Campaigns**

Authoritarian anti-corruption campaigns are at odds with the recognition that corruption plays a crucial role in supporting autocratic stability. Why do autocrats, whose regimes rest on corruption, implement anti-corruption campaigns? Scholars and policymakers believe that the global spread of anti-corruption campaigns into the authoritarian world is a result of international pressure. I challenge this claim and demonstrate that autocratic anti-corruption campaigns are responses to domestic threats to regime stability rather than foreign incentives for fighting corruption.
